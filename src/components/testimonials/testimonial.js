I was able to alleviate many of my symptoms such as sweet craving excessive snacking, migraines, stomach cramps, acid reflux and reverse pre diabetes.  Christie has a very can do attitude and never gave up on me.  She always encourages me and her attitude was always positive.  I was able to lose over 30lbs with Christies guidance and she always express how proud she was of my progress.'

        content: 'Thank you so much for your support and wellness advice. I started this not sure of what to expect but had an open mind. I explained to Christie the issues I had with my nutrition once I moved to the US and how that affected my menstrual cycle, weight, constant allergies and my overall sleeping habit.  Fast-forward a little later my period went from irregular to regular. I now get 9hrs of straight sleep with more energy over the day. I have little to no migraines and no need for daily allergy pills as my immune system is doing a great job now. '

So, I took a shot to contact her after seeing results from a friend that took her service. I dont regret my decision at all!

I loved every recipe that she has prepared for me and now I have energy more than ever! In Wholeness is worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY!! Thank you Christie!'
